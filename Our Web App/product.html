<u><b>MP40:</b></u><br>
    Still the reigning champion when it comes to sheer damage output. <br>
However, the massive power of the MP40 is only offset by its equally-massive<br>
fire rate that drains magazines fairly quickly, as well as its high recoil <br>
that makes it difficult to keep your aim steady while shooting. In other words,<br>
use this gun as you would a shotgun; from a few paces away.
</p>
<p>
<u><b>MP5:</b></u><br>
   The MP5 can totally be used in long distances gunfight, <br>
but it will loses a lot of it's damage capability. Due to its steady fire rate, <br>
this gun can perform well in a medium range and close range gunfight. <br>
A scope can be a useful attachment on the MP5.<br>
</p>
<p>
<u><b>SCAR:</b></u><br>
An Assault rifle is a selective-fire rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge<br>
and a detachable magazine. They have extreme damage power and firing speeds.<br>
With long range firing capacity, it was first brought to production during the world war 2.<br>
The concept of assault rifles is now added to all shooter games.<br>
I will be discussing about one assault rifle in Free Fire.<br>
